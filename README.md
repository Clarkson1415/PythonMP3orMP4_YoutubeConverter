# Youtube to MP3/MP4 Converter

because I am sick of downloading mp3 and mp4 files from annoying ad websites

## Instructions
Install:

1. yt-dlp
2. ffmpeg from https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/
I used the version: ffmpeg-git-full.7z

Configure:
set ffmpeg path on line 25 to where ffmpeg bin folder is installed and extracted to
e.g. 'ffmpeg_location': r'C:\ffmpeg\bin'


## Running the Program
It will ask you to input:
URL
File Path
and mp3 or mp4 format
